1) After the newly created thread has done it's task, java will kill that thread.

2) 1 java thread= 1 os thread

3) In executorservice framework, a blocking queue (thread safe) is used since thread attempt to fetch tasks from the queue concurrently,
that is fetching task at the same time which might cause same task being completed by more than one thread which
leads to waste of resource.

4) N cores = N number of threads running concurrently. Also this will be the ideal number to have that many threads.

5) For IO intensive operations like an http call or database call, it's better to have more threads.
