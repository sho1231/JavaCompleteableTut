1)shutdown method of executor service does not make the codeflow stop for the future
object to finish. It will wait when every other processing is done.

2)runAsync ---> Does not take argument and does not r

3)by default completeable will run on thread from forkjoin pool.

at last write those drawbacks

4)join() of CompleteableFuture will wait for the completeable future to complete
and return the result of the completebale future and can throw unchecked exception if exception
occurs
